# Recon

- Who Is your Target?
- Cloud and Email Services
- Check Social Media

::: notes  
Step 1: As with any engagement.

- Who are your targets?
- What does your target use for email and cloud services?
    - This will be important later when building our own infrastructure
- Check social medias for current events
    - Any celebrations or announcments?
    - Employees complaining about changes?
    - General calendar holidays

# Planning

- Notifying
- Budget
- What are we testing for?

;;; notes

```
- Notify relevant parties
  - Someone at the company you are testing should obviously know.
  - Probalby their email admin in case your tests do get blocked
    - Because successful phishing emails are actually kind of hard
	- Anyone that allows you to test is usually pretty good about blocking things quickly
  - The VPS and mailing service?
    - Technically you probably should
	- Most likely you are violating ToS and they'll just shut you down.
- Budget
  - Cost for a domain name
  - VPS services
  - Mailing service
  - Make use of free tiers when you can?
- What are you testing
    - Credentials?
    - For which site?
    - Target behavior (Do they open it)?
```

;;;

## Planning (cont)

- Your list of targets
- Choose our services
- Select a domain name
- The story

;;; notes

- Planning
    
    - List of targets
        - Your list of emails of course
    - What services are you using.
        - Good idea to match your VPS with the targets cloud provider
        - i.e. Azure for Azure, AWS for AWS
    - Pick a convincing looking domain
    - The story
        - This is why we checked social media.
        - Did they have a baseball opening day party recently? Here's a link to the photos
        - Were there policy changes being announced? Here's a link to an FAQ.
        - Or does the CEO just really need some boner pills.

# Anger the Demo Gods

;;; notes
- DMARC

- RID

Looking closely, we are interesting for the following POST structure request, and more specific for the parameter that holds the current login id.

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=

In order to reflect the actual Microsoftâ€™s connection configuration, we can modify the RecipientParameter parameter Under /gophish/models/campaign.go file path.

const RecipientParameter = "cliend_id"
